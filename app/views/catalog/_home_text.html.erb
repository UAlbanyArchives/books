	Rare Books include several different collections, each with a different scope, purpose, and curatorial history. One uniting principle is the rarity of a text, whether due to a scarcity of extant copies, or because of the annotations of someone important in the particular discipline. Several of our named collections, such as the Kosover, are housed together because of the insights gained from easily accessing similar materials. Ephemeral materials are housed in rare books because their impermanent nature makes them rare, and their being housed together helps them illuminate a historical period or time in intellectual history.

<p class="card-text">
At the University at Albany, the creation of the uptown campus and expansion of disciplines and degrees was the impetus for obtaining rare books to support various disciplines taught at the university. 
</p>

<p class="card-text">
The majority of rare books have author, title, and subject access. Currently, only the <a href="<%= request.base_url + "/books?f[collection_ssim][]=Kosover" %>">Kosover</a> and <a href="<%= request.base_url + "/books?f[collection_ssim][]=O'Reilly" %>">O'Reilly</a> collections are documented in book records and appear as facets, although we are working to add a facet search to other collections in the future.
